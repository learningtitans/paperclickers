# Paperclickers

Paperclickers is low cost alternative to substitute the old clickers in the classroom. Each student gets a card with a visual code, and uses that card to answer the questions asked by the teacher. The teacher uses the phone camera to read the answers. The cards can be printed from the app settings (the gears icon at the first screen). 

## Getting Started

Paperclickers were released as open source software to provide a baseline for future improvement, aiming the broader adoption of Classroom Response Systems, specially when associated with Active Learning methodologies.

### Documentation available

Inside the [doc](doc) and [experiments](experiments) folders you will find some information describing the last research done to create paperclickers.

Under the [topcodes](topcodes) folder you will find the answering cards to be used by the students in some of the supported languages. Paperclickers application also generates those files.
